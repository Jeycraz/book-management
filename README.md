# book-management
This is a book management which i followed  along with a youtube tutorial.

If you want to follow along, i recommend you to watch this youtube tutorial.

This one is very javascript-heavy as it uses mainly on OOP and use constructor to store the data based on the input,
and also how to manage the data and store them into browsers' local storage.

Honestly, i have hard time understanding this also.
